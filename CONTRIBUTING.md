# Contributing to Angular Zenzen

We would love for you to contribute to starter project and help make it even better than it is
today! As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:

## Getting started
Please check out one of the getting started guides about GitHub fork / pull requests workflow:

  * [Forking project](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)
  * [Fork a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
  * [Forking](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962)

## How to sync your fork
Your fork of the repo can fall behind as more work is done in the original repository.
It is always good idea to update your work before starting to work on new issue.
The fork can be updated by navigating to your fork directory and running the following command...
```bash
git checkout master --force && git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/master && git push
```
